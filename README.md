Hi! This is Tanush Reddy Kolagatla (Roll no: 220101101). My branch is Computer Science and engineering. I hail from Bangalore, Karnataka and I am currently residing at Manas Hostel.
I am enjoying learning new things and solving the tasks in the duration of the coding week, and I am looking forward to working with the coding club if possible!
